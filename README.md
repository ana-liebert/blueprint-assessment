## Notes--

I chose to build out this assesment in React, to allow me to easily route for the two exercises on one hosted enviornment

##### Exercise 1:
* Problems 1-3 are completed 
* I've included notes in the javascript file to explain some of my thought process

** Please note ** the table at the initial render is hard coded. Due to an asynchronous issue, I have the code with data fetched commented out. Please comment this in, and see that it does work. 


##### Exercise 2:
* The landing page is developed, using appropriate assets, and is hosted
* Google Forms are hooked up to record the input data, with some level of validation
* The page is somewhat responsive, but not yet fully
* I did not include notes for thought process here because I had too many thoughts :)


### Technologies used:
* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS 
* Bootstrap
* React
* * React Router
