## Notes--

I chose to build out this assesment in React, to allow me to easily route for the two exercises on one hosted enviornment

##### Exercise 1:
* Problems 1-3 are completed 
* I've included notes in the javascript file to explain some of my thought process

** Please note ** the table at the initial render is hard coded. Please view the commented out code as it does function appropriately with the exception of an asychronous issue causing the page to not display


##### Exercise 2:
* The landing page is developed, using appropriate assets, and is hosted
* Google Forms are hooked up to record the input data, with some level of validation
* The page is somewhat responsive, but not yet fully
* I did not include notes for thought process here because I had too many thoughts :)


### Technologies used:
* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS 
* Bootstrap
* React
* * React Router
